In the survey, he asked questions like "Who would Steve Boise go to for help or advice at work?", with each of the other 20 managers listed below. The respondents were asked to place a check beside the names of all the people that Steve Boise is likely to go to. The same question was repeated for each of the 21 managers, thus obtaining 21 networks consisting of the same set of individuals.</p><p>Naturally, each manager can have different perception of the network, depending on their experiences, observations, or acquaintances with each other. For example, in the advice-seeking network presented below, manager 1 provided lots of links while manager 2 provided fewer links. Manager 12 provided more links for some individuals, but fewer links for others.</p><p>The network survey administered by Prof. Krackhardt was designed to investigate different social relationships among the 21 managers in the company. In this study, we will focus on 2 types of relational events: (1) Advice-seeking, and (2) Friendship.</p></div></div><div class="row mt-5 justify-content-md-center" id="background-image-sec"><img src="img/staticCSS_networkPerception.png" class="d-block" alt="CSS Network Snapshots" style="width:500;height:300px;"></div><div class="row mt-5 mb-auto mx-auto w-50 justify-content-center" id="background-nav-btns"><div class="col col-lg-3" id="btn-intro-prev-wrapper"><button class="col mx-1 btn btn-secondary" id="btn-intro-prev" style="display:none">Previous</button></div><div class="mx-auto col-md-auto"></div><div class="col col-lg-3" id="btn-intro-next-wrapper"><button class="col mx-1 btn btn-primary sidenav-btn-custom" id="btn-intro-next">Next</button></div></div></div><script src="js/intro.bundle.js"></script></body></html>
